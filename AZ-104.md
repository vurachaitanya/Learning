-	**Azure Policy:** policy created for company audit compliance. Ex not max size of 4 cpu for a vm can create and apply across the subscription or single subscription.
-	**Azure DevOps** by applying any continuous integration and delivery pipeline policies that affect the pre-deployment and post-deployment of your applications.
-	RBAC focuses on user actions at different scopes. You might be added to the contributor role for a resource group, allowing you to make changes to anything in that resource group
-	Azure Policy focuses on resource properties during deployment and for already-existing resources. Azure Policy controls properties such as the types or locations of resources. 
-	**Azure Policy:** 
1.	Create a policy definition
2.	Assign a definition to a scope of resources
3.	View policy evaluation results
-	**Policy assignment** range from a full subscription down to a resource group. Policy assignments are inherited by all child resources. This inheritance means that if a policy is applied to a resource group, it is applied to all the resources within that resource group.
-	we could enforce a policy for an entire subscription and then exclude a few select resource groups.
-	Policy effects
1.	Deny
2.	Disabled
3.	Append
4.	Audit, AuditIfNotExists
5.	DeployIfNotExists
-	** Initiative :** Managing a few policy definitions is easy, but once you have more than a few, you will want to organize them. That's where initiatives come in. Initiatives work alongside policies in Azure Policy. An initiative definition is a set or group of policy definitions to help track your compliance state for a larger goal.
-	Initiative definitions simplify the process of managing and assigning policy definitions by grouping a set of policies into a single item.
-	**Azure Management Groups:** On your first management group, a root management group is created in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) organization. By default, the root management group's display name is Tenant root group. The ID is the Azure AD ID. After this group is created, all existing subscriptions in the Azure AD organization are made children of the root management group. 
1.	Any Azure AD user in the organization can create a management group. The creator is given an Owner role assignment.
2.	A single Azure AD organization can support 10,000 management groups.
3.	A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth not including the Root level or subscription level.
4.	Each management group can have many children.
5.	When your organization creates subscriptions, they are automatically added to the root management group.
-	**Azure Blueprints** makes it possible for development teams to rapidly build and deploy new environments with the trust they're building within organizational compliance using a set of built-in components, such as networking, to speed up development and delivery.
-	The Azure Blueprints service is designed to help with environment setup. This setup often consists of a set of resource groups, policies, role assignments, and Resource Manager template deployments. Ultimately, each setup is assigned to a subscription in a single operation that can be audited and tracked.
-	With Blueprints, the relationship between the blueprint definition (what should be deployed) and the blueprint assignment (what was deployed) is preserved. This connection supports improved tracking and auditing of deployments. Blueprints can also upgrade several subscriptions at once that are governed by the same blueprint.
-	Microsoft takes this management seriously and provides full transparency with four sources:
1.	Microsoft Privacy Statement
2.	Microsoft Trust Center
3.	Service Trust Portal
4.	Compliance Manager
-	Azure provides two primary services to monitor the health of your apps and resources.
1.	Azure Monitor
2.	Azure Service Health

-	**Azure Monitor** : 
1.	Application Insights is a service that monitors the availability, performance, and usage of your web applications, whether they're hosted in the cloud or on-premises
2.	Azure Monitor for containers:  collecting memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers, which are available in Kubernetes through the metrics API. Container logs are also collected.
3.	Azure Monitor for VMs:  Azure Monitor for VMs includes support for monitoring performance and application dependencies for VMs hosted on-premises, and for VMs hosted with other cloud providers.
4.	Alerts. Azure Monitor proactively notifies you of critical conditions using alerts, and can potentially attempt to take corrective actions
5.	Autoscale. Azure Monitor uses Autoscale to ensure that you have the right amount of resources running to manage the load on your application effectively. Autoscale enables you to create rules that use metrics, collected by Azure Monitor, to determine when to automatically add resources to handle increases in load
6.	Azure Service Health is a suite of experiences that provide personalized guidance and support when issues with Azure services affect you. It can notify you, help you understand the impact of issues, and keep you updated as the issue is resolved. Azure Service Health can also help you prepare for planned maintenance and changes that could affect the availability of your resources.
